# odin-calculator

This is the final project of the Foundations course. Our final project is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browser’s console:
add
subtract
multiply
divide

A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. I will create three variables, one for each part of the operation. I’ll use these variables to update my display.
